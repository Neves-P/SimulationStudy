Upload trees that have been created by uniformly sampling parameter space for the sELDiG Simulation Experiment.

As before, we are only interested in the phylogenetic tree output of the simulation, stored in Newick format (with a .tre extension). 
Tree files should be saved with a consistent abbreviation for the model that we’ve been using (e.g. hs, pontarp, fh, etc.) followed by an underscore and then an integer representing the simID. 

Also to this folder, please upload a parameters file 
labeled "[model]_USE_parameters.csv" where [model] is the model abbreviation
Column 1 is named "model" and is filled with the model abbreviation
Column 2 is called "simID"
Subsequent columns correspond to the parameters of your model
