Add phylogenies produced by your simulation model to this 'tree' folder in Newick format.

Please use the following convention for filenames:

*ss_x.tre*

where

*ss*: 	is the 2-letter abbreviation for the simulation author(s)  
	(e.g., 'hs' = Hurlbert & Stegen, 'po' = Pontarp, etc.)
*x*:	is a 1-5 digit simulation ID that will allow you to link this tree to the parameter settings that generated it
