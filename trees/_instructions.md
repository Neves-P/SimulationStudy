## Instructions

Add phylogenies produced by your simulation model to this 'tree' folder in Newick format.

Please use the following convention for filenames:

**ss_x.tre**

where

**ss**: is the 2-letter abbreviation for the simulation author(s) (e.g., 'hs' = Hurlbert & Stegen, 'po' = Pontarp, etc.)  
**x**:	is a 1-5 digit simulation ID that will allow you to link this tree to the parameter settings that generated it

Eventually, each simulation ID will be entered as a row in our [Simulation Classification spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pcUuINauW11cE5OpHVQf_ZuzHzhm2VJkCn7-lSEJXYI/edit#gid=0). 
For the moment, the structure of this spreadsheet is still being revised.
